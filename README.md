# Hey! Wake Up! 

## Background  
Hey! Wake Up! is a game that builds up on the concept of students taking a nap when the teachers have their backs against them. The game will have approximately 3 to 6 levels and the player will have 30 to 120 seconds to help the students wake up depending on the level they are playing. Each level will display 4 to 12 students and 1 teacher on the web page. Each student will have a energy level status showing how sleepy they are.

The game will require the player to keep clicking on the students that are falling asleep to give them more energy. After the timer is up, the teacher will turn his/her face around and looking for students that are sleeping. If a student's energy level status is below 50%, the player fails. To pass each level, the players must ensure all students have their energy above or equal to 50% when the timer ends.

## Technologies, Libraries, and APIs
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:  
`Canvas API`: render the game graphics (Might not need Canvas API to render game graphics, to be updated)  
<!-- `Anime.css`: apply animation effects when players click on the screen -->
`font-awesome`: Used font-awesome api to render icons  
`google-fonts`: Used google font api for creative fonts

## Implementation Timeline
- __Friday Afternoon & Weekend__: Finish building the UI for one level, set up most of the css styling for the students and the rest of the game page. Ready to render the game home page by the end of Friday Night and have the first three levels ready on Monday morning.
- __Monday__: Continue working on the game view, and allow players to modify some settings of the game such as muting the background music and sound effects.
- __Tuesday__: Continue working on the game view until everything is ready for hosting on GitHub Pages. If time allows, adding more levels to the game.
- __Wednesday__: Deploy to GitHub pages and make sure the game renders correctly on both Windows and Mac, and on different browsers.
- __Thursday Morning__: Check if there is any bugs in the game, and if time allows, fix the bugs and rewrite README with the most updated information.
